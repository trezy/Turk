Turk is an IRC client built with node-irc and Electron.

# Development

Run `grunt` to compile everything and watch for changes, then `npm start` to load up the app.

# Packaging

The `grunt dist` task will:

* Make sure all of our files are compiled and minified;
* Create binaries from the compiled files and gather the necessary drivers to be packaged;
* Build installers or the binaries.

Woot, you're done! :-)
